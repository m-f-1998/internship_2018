# Internship 2018

With the introduction of a new Trench-Heating line at Turnbull & Scott Engineers, I was tasked with creating a WordPress powered tool which would allow customers to efficiently browse available variations based upon their filters. Additionally, customers could customise their selected products; add accessories; and download a PDF document detailing their choices with an estimated price. 

The internship included: coding using a variety of languages; managing the creation of a front-end web page; interaction with the core WordPress database; and the creation of back-end UI which could update the database without the need for coding expertise. Time management was important as I was balancing the functionality expectations of Turnbull & Scott; the production deadlines of Attacat (Turnbull & Scottâ€™s contracted Internet Marketing Service); and completing an achievable final product within a tight deadline of my contracted 10 weeks.
